<h2>here i will type an essay</h2>
<p>what is an essay? a collection of words? no, a collection of scentences? who truly knows. I have written countless essays in my time as a student. Only some I have actually enjoyed writing.<br> <br> One of said essays was a commentary on the film <i>The Handmaiden</i>, the other was an economical report on Hello Kitty and her impact on marketing. </p>
